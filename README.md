### What I learned

This is my first challenge with JavaScript; I have learned to implement an accordion using buttons. I've also had chance to learn aboslute/relative image positioning, which can be challenging sometimes.
I've had a big headache with the background for the mobile view, as the linear gradient was only extending until the end of the viewport and leaving a
whte space when scrolling down. I've found a solution for this in the stackoverflow link below.
